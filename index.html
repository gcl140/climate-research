                    <!-- Background -->
                </h3>
                <p>This study aims to assess the level of knowledge among youth regarding the effectiveness of various 
                    individual actions in mitigating climate change. To achieve this, a quantitative data collection and analysis 
                    approach was employed. Data was collected through an online survey targeting youth aged 15 to 24, 
                    addressing existing knowledge gaps in this demographic. The analysis of the collected data shows that 
                    youth have a limited understanding of the effectiveness of different individual actions in contributing to 
                    climate change mitigation. Additionally, the findings indicate that social media serves as the primary 
                    source of information for young people concerning climate change. This implies that to win youth in 
                    imparting knowledge, social media is among the most powerful tools to use. Based on these findings, it is 
                    recommended that youth be actively involved in advocacy efforts related to climate change and that 
                    initiatives aimed at climate change mitigation be strengthened through targeted outreach on social media 
                platforms.  </p>

                <!-- <h3 id="section3">
                    Purpose
                </h3>
                <p>Understanding that youth comprise 60% of Tanzania's population, this retrospective study
                    sought to assess the knowledge of Tanzanian youths on the effectiveness of their individual
                    actions against Climate Change and identify factors that are associated with the acquisition of
                    this knowledge. </p>

                <h3 id="section4">
                    Methodology
                </h3>
                <p>The study surveyed 300 youth aged 15-24 years in the Dar es Salaam region. Youth were asked
                    to rank six individual-level actions based on their perceived relative effectiveness in reducing
                    carbon emissions. Data on their age, education level, sex, involvement in environmental
                    initiatives, and experience with climate disasters was also collected. Respondents were also
                    asked to name their sources of information regarding Climate Change and to state their personal
                    beliefs on whether individual actions can lessen it. We then used Wilcoxon-signed rank tests to
                    determine if there are significant differences in how youth rank the impacts of various
                    individual actions compared to established rankings of Wynes & Nicholas. The Chi-squared
                    and one-way ANOVA tests were also performed to identify statistically significant differences
                    in knowledge levels based on select independent variables.</p>

                <h3 id="section5">
                    Results
                </h3>
                <p>Results showed that knowledge of the effectiveness of individual-level climate mitigation
                    actions was poor: low-impact actions such as recycling were overestimated in relative
                    significance while high-impact actions, such as having one fewer child, were underestimated.
                    Additionally, the data shows that social media is the main source of knowledge on Climate
                    Change for youth. Moreover, the study found that factors such as higher education levels, active
                    participation in environmental activities, personal experiences with adverse climate change
                    related events, and the perceived risk of adverse Climate Change-related impacts were
                    significantly associated with better knowledge of the effectiveness of individual actions in
                    mitigating Climate Change. However, no significant differences in knowledge were observed
                    in different age groups, gender groups, reported sources of Climate Change information, or
                    personal beliefs in whether individual actions can lessen Climate Change.</p>

                <h3 id="section6">
                    Conclusion
                </h3>
                <p>The study results suggest that although the majority of Tanzanian youth are concerned with the
                    problem of Climate Change, they are not equipped with the requisite knowledge to maximize
                    Climate Change mitigation through their personal actions. These findings inform educators,
                    policymakers, and environmental organizations to develop more targeted educational
                    strategies, such as updating school curricula and community-based initiatives to empower
                    youth to adopt impactful individual actions to mitigate Climate Change. Moreover, considering
                    that social media serves as the principal information source for young individuals, educators
                    ought to utilize these platforms to disseminate content on effective Climate Change mitigation
                    techniques.</p> -->

                <h2>General Introduction</h2>
                <p>Climate change is an ongoing global issue with significant social, economic, and environmental
                    consequences. To keep global warming to 1.5°C over pre-industrial levels, the
                    Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has emphasized the need for immediate
                    action. According to the IPCC's research, a 1.5°C increase will result in more extreme weather
                    events, higher sea levels, and negative effects on ecosystems, food security, and human health
                    (IPCC, 2021). Agreements and commitments all over the world, such as the 2015 Paris
                    Agreement, highlight the need for both group and individual efforts. Developing measures to
                    reduce greenhouse gas emissions and submitting nationally determined contributions (NDCs)
                    are incentivized. Academicians and policymakers also encourage more public awareness and
                    individual actions including lowering carbon footprints by means of sustainable consumption,
                    energy saving, and engagement in environmental projects (Stern, 2000).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Recent global projects like the Fridays for Future movement led by student activist Greta
                    Thunberg indicate that youth play a vital role in contributing to the mitigation of climate
                    change. Youth are more likely to embrace sustainable practices and participate in eco-friendly
                    activities, particularly in developed countries. Though many youths are becoming more aware
                    of the climate situation, there is growing concern that they might not completely understand
                    how their actions could have a significant influence (O’Brien et al., 2018).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because of its reliance on rain-fed agriculture, water shortages, and little ability for adaptation,
                    the African continent is especially vulnerable to the consequences of climate change. With an
                    eye towards regional collaboration, the African Union (AU) and regional organizations like the
                    East African Community (EAC) have created climate change frameworks. Programs like the
                    African Adaptation Initiative (AAI) demonstrate the need for local involvement and the
                    empowerment of vulnerable groups, especially the youth, in order to tackle the climate crisis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Climate change in Tanzania presents hazards to livelihoods, particularly in rural areas where
                    tourism, fishing, and agriculture are dominant. The Tanzanian government has promised to
                    include strategies for reducing and adjusting to climate change within its national development
                    goals. Some of the objectives set in Tanzania's Nationally Determined Contribution are
                    afforestation, sustainable land management, and the lowering of greenhouse gas emissions by
                    renewable energy projects (URT, 2021). Despite these initiatives, citizen's knowledge and
                    understanding of climate change and the efficacy of individual actions remains limited.
                    Research indicates that many youth from Tanzania are somewhat aware of climate change but
                    are not sure how their behaviors could influence global mitigating initiatives (Kangalawe &
                    Lyimo, 2013).

            <div id="section8">
                <h2>Statement of the problem </h2>
                <p>The global climate crisis has raised concerns about the effectiveness of individual actions in
                    mitigating climate change, yet youth’s awareness and knowledge on this matter remain unclear.
                    Literature suggests that youth’s openness to embracing sustainable lifestyle make them a key
                    demographic in driving environmental change (O'Brien & Selboe, 2015). Nonetheless, a
                    knowledge deficit exists about their understanding of the effects of their individual actions on
                    climate change mitigation. In numerous developing nations, like Tanzania, initiatives aimed at
                    educating the youth about climate change frequently emphasize large-scale interventions, such
                    as tree-planting campaigns or beach cleanups, neglecting the significance of minor, daily
                    decisions such as energy saving, recycling, and sustainable consumerism (UNESCO, 2016).
                    The youth may underestimate their significance in climate action due to a lack of
                    understanding, leading to inadequate participation in personal behavioral adjustments meant to
                    lower carbon emissions.
                </p>

                <p>Moreover, despite worldwide efforts to inform the public on climate change, research indicates
                    that young people's understanding of the issue is often limited and inadequate, especially in
                    evaluating the impact of personal actions contribute to larger climate objectives (Leiserowitz
                    et al., 2020). In Tanzania, where the effects of climate change are more apparent, there is a lack
                    of empirical study about the awareness of young individuals concerning their roles in climate
                    resilience (Mwenda, 2019). This gap pertains to the extent of youth’s knowledge concerning
                    the efficacy of different climate change mitigation measures.

                    Youth
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Globally, the United Nations (UN) defines youth as individuals aged between 15 and 24 years (UN,
                    2021). Also, the African Youth Charter categorizes youth as persons between 15 and 35 years old
                    (African Union, 2006). In Tanzania, the National Youth Development Policy defines youth as
                    individuals aged between 15 and 35 years, acknowledging the extended period of dependency and
                    socio-economic challenges many young people face in the country (URT, 2007). In this study, the
                    global view of youth was adopted as the term youth represented individuals ranging from 15-24 and
                    was used to understand their level of awareness in action related to climate change.

                    Climate action
                </h3>
                <p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines climate action as lowering
                    greenhouse gas emissions, switching to sustainable energy sources, and improving society
                    adaption to climate-related hazards (IPCC, 2018). Defining climate action, according to Moser
                    (2010), is not just a technological fix but also a change in policies and society behavior meant
                    to adapt and lessen climatic problems. Climate action in this study will also consist of direct or
                    indirect measures meant to help to either solve or lessen the climate crisis.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Climate change mitigation
                </h3>
                <p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines mitigation as human actions
                    meant to either lower the sources of greenhouse gases or improve the sinks of GHCs (IPCC,
                    2014). Stern (2007) also defines climate mitigating as the global response to lower emissions
                    by means of using low-carbon technologies, enhancing energy efficiency, and harnessing of
                    renewable energy sources. In this study, the definition of IPCC we adopted as climate
                    mitigation suggests any intervention, initiative, or action meant to reduce the impact associated
                    with climate change.

                    change. This approach facilitated the collection of data at a single point in time, therefore

                    behaviour among the youth. The approach focused on participants aged 15 to 24, residing in
                    Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The region was purposefully selected due to its diverse population
                    and status as a commercial hub, which ensured access to participants from a range of social,
                    economic, and cultural backgrounds. This diversity was essential to capture varied perspectives
                    on climate change mitigation behaviours.
                </p>

                <p>Data collection involved an online survey to assess youths' knowledge regarding individual
                    level climate change mitigation behaviours which was categorized based on their impact level
                    on climate change mitigation. Participants were asked to rank these behaviours based on their
                    perceived effectiveness in reducing climate change.

                <p>
                    The data collected were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 29. The analyzed data were
                    presented in tables to describe the information and its implications. The descriptive analysis was
                    performed to analyze the demographic by calculating the frequency and percentage of the
                    participants' demographic. But also, the Chi-squared test was performed to identify statistically
                    significant differences in knowledge levels based on socio-demographic characteristics, and beliefs
                    Pickering et al. (2020). Additionally, one-way ANOVA tests explored correlations between
                    participants’ knowledge scores and their reported sources of information on climate change.

                    Demographic characteristics
                </h3>
                <p>The gender distribution data indicates that males constitute 63.3% (190 participants) of the
                    sample, and females represent 36.7% (110 participants). This signifies a notable gender
                    disparity, which may affect the study's conclusions, particularly if the research addresses
                    subjects where gender is essential, such as engagement in economic activities or social
                    behaviors. The underrepresentation of females may indicate prevailing gender disparities
                    within the community or may be a consequence of sample selection procedures.
                </p>

                <p>The age distribution of the sample is primarily comprised of persons aged 15-19 years,
                    representing 60% of the participants (180 participants). Forty percent (120 participants) are in
                    the 20-24 age category. The predominance of younger participants may influence the
                    conclusions, especially in studies related to education, work, or health, as younger individuals
                    may possess distinct viewpoints and experiences relative to their older counterparts.
                    The majority of the sample, 39.3% (118 participants), has attained primary schooling.
                    Secondary education is the second most prevalent level, including 29% (87 participants), but a
                    lesser proportion of participants (8.7%, or 26 participants) have achieved university-level
                    education. Twenty-three percent (69 participants) lack formal schooling. This educational
                    distribution may reflect the broader access to education in the community and could influence
                    several socio-economic variables, including employment, income creation, and resource
                    accessibility. The comparatively low proportion of individuals with higher education may also
                    influence the ability to make educated decisions in domains such as climate change mitigation,
                    civic engagement, or economic empowerment.
                </p>

                <p>This study investigated youths' understanding of the efficacy of individual efforts in alleviating
                    climate change. We posed two research questions about the accuracy of teenagers'
                    understanding of the efficacy of individual activities in alleviating climate change and the
                    factors that affect their knowledge of these actions' effectiveness.
                </p>

                <p>Three hundred youths from the Dar es Salaam region of Tanzania participated in a 10-minute
                    survey designed to evaluate their understanding of the efficacy of various individual actions in
                    combating climate change, as well as the factors influencing their knowledge on this subject.
                    The ages of participants varied from 15 to 24 years. Approximately 51.7% of the participants
                    were female, and over 37.3% possessed a primary education level.

                    Level of Knowledge about individual actions that could mitigate climate change
                </h3>
                <p>This was addressed by looking at how the respondents were aware of the effectiveness of their
                    actions which could contribute to climate mitigation. Respondents were given six actions that
                    individuals could personally take to help lessen Climate Change and were asked to rank them
                    (from 1-6) according to their perceived effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
                    from the highest rank to the lowest. The data showed that youths ranked recycling as the most
                    effective (mean rank of 1.5) this was followed by living car-free (mean rank of 2.6), replacing
                    gasoline cars with hybrid cars (mean rank of 3.8), upgrading light bulbs (mean rank of 3.8),
                    Eat a plant-based diet (mean rank of 4.0) and the least effective action was considered to be
                    having one free child (mean rank of 5.3). (Figure 1).

                </p>
                
                <br>

                <p>We then used Wilcoxon signed rank tests to determine if there are significant differences in 
                    how youth rank the impact of various individual actions compared to established rankings of 
                    Wynes et al (5). The test demonstrated statistically significant variations on how youths ranked 
                    these behaviors in comparison to the calculated rankings derived from a study by of Wynes et 
                    al (5). Youths rated recycling" (Z = -15.5 p < 0.0001) to be the most impactful, this was 
                    followed by living car free (Z = -9.2 p < 0.0001), replacing gasoline cars with hybrid cars ((Z 
                    = -2.4 p < 0.017), upgrading light bulbs (Z = -14.1 p < 0.0001), Eat a plant-based diet (Z = 
                    10.4 p < 0.0001) and the least effective action was considered to be having one free child (Z = -15.4 p < 0.0001) This may be because of the truth that most of the climate activist they most 
                    talk about the issue of recycling. But also, most of the intervention proceeding in the local 
                    community is the issue of recycling and forgetting to speak about other behaviors that are most 
                    contributing to climate change mitigation.  This data implies the existing gap in awareness 
                    regarding the actions contributing to climate change. This was supported by (Ivanaj, 2024) 
                    explain the increase in publicly available information about the causes and consequences of 
                    climate change, as well as about actions to be taken to mitigate it, has an important positive 
                    influence on public problem awareness. This in turn positively influences both personal 
                    efficacy and public behavioral intentions to fight climate change, two key mediators that spur 
                    positive changes in desired climate-friendly public behaviors according to (Wolf & Moser, 
                    2019) the review highlights great variation and sometimes a direct contradiction of view. This 
                    calls for attention regarding knowledge of public understanding and engagement. 
                </p>

                <p>From this study youths with personal experiences of climate-related events possessed 
                    significantly greater knowledge of the effectiveness of individual climate change mitigation 
                    actions compared to those without such experiences. These findings indicate that personal 
                    experiences with climate-related events such as floods, droughts, or extreme weather 
                    conditions often serve as powerful motivators for individuals to seek more information about 
                    climate change and its mitigation(Sambrook et al., 2021). Those who have lived through 
                    climate-related events are more likely to engage in discussions, educational programs, and 
                    community initiatives focused on climate change(Sambrook et al., 2021). These findings align 
                    with existing literature where Spence et al found that individuals who had experienced flooding 
                    had a significantly higher awareness and concern about climate change(Spence et al., 2011). 
                    Personal experiences with flooding /droughts tend to provide survivors with opportunities to 
                    learn about effective climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies and their potential 
                    impact(Demski et al., 2017). Education programs should incorporate personal stories and case 
                    studies of individuals who have experienced climate-related events. As Ardoin et al. pointed 
                    out in their analysis of environmental education programs, storytelling, especially involving 
                    real-life experiences, increased student engagement and retention of information(Ardoin et al., 
                    2020).

                    Factors of the effectiveness of individual actions that could mitigate climate change
                </h3>

                <p>Regarding demographic factors, the effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) was not found to 
                    show statistically significant variation among gender (p = 0.093) or age groups (p = 0.650). 
                    However, statistically significant differences were observed among different educational levels 
                    (p = 0.015, where participants having university education levels demonstrated lower EKS 
                    (mean = 1.9) compared to those with no education, primary education levels, and secondary 
                    education (mean EKS was 2.4. 2.3 and 2.2, respectively). We also determined that the 
                    effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) showed significant variation among those with 
                    participation in different environmental activities (p= 0.015) where those who have participated 
                    in different environmental activities demonstrated lower EKS (mean 2.0) compared to those 
                    who had not participated in different environmental activities (mean 2.4). 
                </p>

                <p>In addition, the effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) showed significant variation among those 
                    with personal experiences with climate-related events whereas those with personal experiences 
                    with climate-related events demonstrated lower EKS (mean 2.1) compared to those who had 
                    no personal experiences with climate-related events (mean 2.3). The effectiveness knowledge 
                    score (EKS) also showed significant variation (p-value = 0.000) among those who believed 
                    that they were at risk of climate change-related events (mean 2.0) and those who perceived 
                    they were at no risk (mean 2.3). We also asked participants whether they believe individual 
                    actions or lifestyle choices can help mitigate climate change. A majority of youth (83.7%) 
                    responded that they did believe their actions or lifestyle choices could help in the mitigation of 
                    climate change. Those who didn’t believe in the effectiveness of their actions were asked to 
                    provide reasons for their disbelief. Majority attributed their skepticism to external factors such 
                    as placing responsibility for pollution on large companies and corporations. Additionally, some 
                    expressed a feeling of helplessness to take responsibility stating reasons like "I don’t see others 
                    doing it, so why should I?" or “Changing habits is very challenging." Some respondents 
                    displayed a lack of awareness about climate change with comments such as "Climate change

                    actions impact climate change". In general, responses indicated that participants could be 
                    categorized as belonging to one of two groups—those who generally perceived that their 
                    actions couldn't make a difference and finally those who lacked awareness on climate change, 
                    its causes, and mitigation actions. (Figure 2).

                <p>The study's conclusions highlight the necessity for customized educational and awareness 
                    programs that address the inadequate understanding prevalent across various demographic 
                    groups. Although a significant majority of youth (83.7%) believe in the efficacy of individual 
                    measures to combat climate change, many have doubts stemming from perceived external 
                    influences or feelings of impotence. This indicates that educating citizens about climate change 
                    by itself is not enough. There is a need for the implementation of effective communication 
                    tactics to empower and get them engaged. To overcome barriers, such as the belief that largely 
                    affects changing personnel must focus on community-driven approaches that illustrate the 
                    tangible impacts of collective individual actions. By bridging information gaps and developing 
                    a sense of urgency, these initiatives could improve public comprehension of climate change 
                    and encourage active involvement in mitigation solutions.                     
                </p>

                <p>The study found that youths with personal experiences of climate-related events had much 
                    stronger understanding of the efficacy of individual climate change mitigation activities than 
                    those without such experiences. This finding suggest that personal encounters with climate
                    related disasters, whether floods, droughts, or other severe weather occurrences, frequently act 
                    as motivators for individuals to seek further information regarding climate change and its 
                    mitigation (Sambrook et al., 2021). Individuals who have experienced climate-related disasters 
                    are more inclined to engage in conversations, educational programs, and community initiatives 
                    centered on climate change (Sambrook et al., 2021). These findings correspond with current 
                    literature, as Spence et al. discovered that people who experienced flooding notably had greater 
                    awareness and concern over climate change (Spence et al., 2011). Survivors of flooding and 
                    drought often get insights about successful climate change mitigation and adaptation 
                    techniques and their potential effects (Demski et al., 2017). Educational programs ought to 
                    integrate personal narratives and case studies of individuals who have encountered climate
                    related occurrences. Ardoin et al. highlighted in their examination of environmental education 
                    programs that storytelling, particularly with real-life events, enhanced student engagement and 
                    information retention (Ardoin et al., 2020). 
                </p>

                <p>The research also emphasized the need of education in promoting climate awareness. 
                    Individuals possessing higher educational attainment, especially those with university degrees, 
                    had a superior comprehension of acts with significant impact, as shown by lower effectiveness 
                    knowledge scores (EKS) relative to individuals with lesser educational qualifications. This 
                    indicates that increased exposure to scientific knowledge, particularly among individuals with 
                    university education, equips youth with a more thorough comprehension of environmental 
                    challenges. Youth with advanced education, such as university degrees, are more likely to 
                    engage in conversations regarding the implications of population dynamics, energy 
                    consumption, and sustainable practices, topics that may not be extensively addressed in lower 
                    educational levels (Wang et al., 2022). A study investigating public perceptions of climate 
                    change in 119 countries revealed that education accurately predicts climate change knowledge, 
                    with individuals possessing higher education levels demonstrating a greater comprehension of 
                    the causes of climate change and various mitigation strategies (Feinstein & Mach, 2020).  
                </p>

                <p>It is important to note that in most African nations, just 23% to 33% of the students finish 
                    secondary education, and the present gross university enrollment ratio is at merely 9.4% 
                    (Dispatch & Richard, 2024). Therefore, it is essential to incorporate extensive climate 
                    education at all educational levels. This approach can overcome the knowledge gap and 
                    guarantee that all people, irrespective of their educational background, possess a fundamental 
                    understanding of the most efficient measures to address climate change. This will empower 
                    youth to make more informed decisions and have a stronger collective influence on mitigating 
                    greenhouse gas emissions. It is essential to remember that nearly 11% of youth in Tanzania 
                    lack formal education (Profile, 2018), and our study indicated that these youths were 
                    uninformed about the efficacy of climate mitigation behaviors, as evidenced by their elevated 
                    effectiveness knowledge score (EKS). Consequently, authorities must identify effective 
                    strategies to engage this demographic of young people. Excluding them due to their absence 
                    from school would be a considerable error, as they represent a vital segment of the Tanzanian 
                    youth community. 
                </p>

                <p>Furthermore, the study pointed out that people engaged in various environmental activities 
                    have superior knowledge regarding the relative efficacy of specific climate change mitigation 
                    measures compared to those who do not participate. This study indicates that more participation 
                    among youth in activities targeting environmental challenges correlates with enhanced 
                    understanding of influential behaviors and actions. Our findings align with the prior research 
                    done by Ardoin et al., which indicated that students engaging in outdoor environmental 
                    programs exhibited a greater environmental understanding and pro-environmental behaviors 
                    relative to their non-participating counterparts (Ardoin et al., 2020). This shows the importance 
                    of active engagement in improving awareness of climate challenges. Participation in 
                    environmental activities frequently consists of educational resources, workshops, and debates 
                    that enhance understanding of the causes and effects of climate change. This hints at the 
                    necessity of utilizing education to foster climate change and mitigation awareness by 
                    encouraging engagement at all levels of the community. A study by Akrofi et al. indicates that 
                    to attain effective climate change action, it is crucial to increase youth’s participation in climate 
                    change initiatives (Akrofi et al., 2019). 
                </p>

                <h3 id="section17">Source of knowledge about climate change</h3>
                <p>The study also aims to understand youth’s source of knowledge on climate change. The 
                    respondents were asked to select their source of knowledge. The data presents the participants’ 
                    responses, revealing distinct differences in the frequency of responses. Social media is the most 
                    significant source, with 90 respondents indicating it as their primary means of obtaining 
                    information. Subsequently, the internet garnered 63 responses, while mass media attracted 53. 
                    Family and friends contributed 47 responses, local community contributed 31, and government 
                    agencies accounted for only 17 as presented in the figure below. These data show that most 
                    youth rely on digital platforms, particularly social media, for information regarding climate 
                    change.
                </p>

                <p>This data implies that there is value in utilizing social media and online platforms to 
                    disseminate information on climate change effectively. Since youth are highly engaged with 
                    these sources, educational initiatives and awareness campaigns can be more impactful if 
                    conducted through these channels. This trend also indicates a potential gap in the effectiveness 
                    of traditional information sources, such as government agencies and local communities, 
                    suggesting a need for these entities to adapt their strategies to better engage youth.

                    <p>This indicates that youth lack the knowledge of the actual effectiveness of different individual 
                        climate change mitigation actions. Such a knowledge gap has also been documented in a study 
                        by Pickering et al his study involved 17-18years old Canadian youths where impact behaviors 
                        such as recycling and reducing waste were overestimated as highly impactful 
                        behaviors(Pickering et al., 2020) and from a study by Truelove and Gillis where participants 
                        consistently 
                        ranked recycling higher than scientifically supported high-impact 
                        actions(Truelove & Parks, 2012). This overestimation can be explained by the fact that 
                        recycling is one of the most visible and easily accessible actions and is more encouraged 
                        through public campaigns, community programs, and educational efforts, which tend to create 
                        a perception of them being a highly effective action. It should also be noted that actions such 
                        as recycling and upgrading light bulbs are actions that youths can exert significant control. 
                        Other actions such as eating a plant-based diet and living car-free require more resources and 
                        autonomy within family environments(Pickering et al., 2020). 
                    </p>

                    <p>Moreover, participants in this study ranked having fewer children as least effective, a finding 
                        that contrasts sharply with the calculated ranks proposed by the study of Wynes et al which 
                        ranked it as the most impactful behaviors(Wynes & Nicholas, 2017). This shows that youths 
                        are not fully aware of the significant impact that population growth has on greenhouse gas 
                        emissions. According to of Wynes et al study, having one fewer child can achieve emissions 
                        reductions equivalent to those made by 684 teenagers adopting lifelong comprehensive 
                        recycling habits(Wynes & Nicholas, 2017). Similar findings were reported in a study done by 
                        Pickering et al where Canadian youth ranked having fewer than one child as the least effective 
                        action(Pickering et al., 2020).  Such misunderstandings stem from the fact that while actions 
                        such as recycling are often promoted in environmental campaigns, the link between family 
                        planning and climate change is highlighted less frequently, particularly in youth-targeted 
                        education(Götmark & Andersson, 2020). Additionally, in African societies, such as those in 
                        Tanzania, the decision to have children is deeply embedded in traditions, cultural expectations, 
                        and economic considerations, making the concept of having fewer children less likely to be 
                        considered or prioritized by individuals(Maning et al., 2024). In Tanzania, where the population 
                        is projected to double every 23 years, climate change mitigation conversations should be 
                        broadened to include discussions on the long-term implications of increased population growth 
                        on carbon emissions(‘TANZANIA: Economic Update’, 2021). Opting to have one fewer child, 
                        as noted by Wynes et al., can achieve emissions reductions similar to those made by 684 
                        teenagers adopting lifelong comprehensive recycling habits(Wynes & Nicholas, 2017). The 
                        impact of this choice is significant due to the cumulative reduction in emissions across future 
                        generations, as highlighted in life cycle assessments by Murtaugh and Schlax(Murtaugh & 
                        Schlax, 2009).

                    <p>We also performed a series of one-way ANOVA tests to explore potential correlations between 
                        different sources of information about climate change, as reported by respondents and their 
                        effectiveness knowledge score (EKS). However, all tests resulted in non-significant results (p 
                        > 0.05). This suggests that no statistically significant associations were observed between any 
                        specific information source and participants' EKS in this study. We also performed logistic 
                        regression to identify independent factors associated with youth’s knowledge of the

                        found to be associated with youth’s knowledge with 95% CI were; participation in 
                        environmental activities (adjusted odds ratio of 3.6(1.9-6.7 and p = 0.000) Perceived risk of 
                        climate change-related hazards (adjusted odds ratio of 4.90(2.25-10.68) and p= 0.000) and

                    <p>In this study, we aimed to explore youth’s knowledge of the effectiveness of individual actions 
                        for mitigating climate change.  First, we assessed the knowledge of the relative effectiveness 
                        of different individual climate mitigation actions. Second, we looked into what factors were 
                        associated with youth’s knowledge of the relative effectiveness of different individual climate 
                        mitigation actions. Our findings showed that youth overestimated the effectiveness of low
                        impact behaviors while underestimating the effectiveness of the high-impact behaviors.  
                    </p>

                    <p>Additionally, our study aligned with a study done by Pickering et al., highlighting that obtaining 
                        information from different sources had no association with knowledge of the effectiveness of 
                        individual climate change mitigation actions (Pickering et al., 2020). This can be attributed to 
                        the fact that various sources, like the internet, social media, or mass media, convey similar 
                        messages regarding climate change mitigation, eventually leading to a uniform level of 
                        knowledge among participants regardless of the particular sources(Adetayo et al., 2023). It 
                        should also be pointed out that the effectiveness of information in enhancing knowledge may 
                        depend more on its quality and depth rather than the medium in which it is distributed. (Adetayo 
                        et al., 2023). That is to say, brief news headlines or social media posts may raise awareness but 
                        lack the depth necessary to substantially enhance the audience's knowledge. To enrich public 
                        understanding towards climate change mitigation, it is important to incorporate diverse 
                        perspectives and approaches in educational and communication strategies.
                    </p>

                    <p>Our study also found no significant difference in the knowledge of the effectiveness of 
                        individual climate change mitigation actions between individuals who believe their actions or 
                        lifestyle choices can contribute to reducing climate change and their fellow counterparts who 
                        do not. Similar findings were obtained from a study done by Pickering et al. (2020), where 
                        knowledge showed no significant variation in youth’s beliefs on whether their actions or 
                        lifestyle choices can contribute to reducing climate change. This hints at a general lack of 
                        awareness or understanding about specific actions that can effectively mitigate climate change 
                        among both groups. This suggests that individuals, regardless of belief, may not have access to 
                        detailed information on the effectiveness of different actions. Efforts should be made to address 
                        the gap between beliefs and knowledge. This involves creating educational content that 
                        resonates with individuals' values and beliefs while providing clear, actionable information 
                        about climate change mitigation.  
                    </p>

                    <p>Furthermore, the study found that factors such as participation in environmental activities, 
                        perceived risk of climate change-related hazards, and personal experiences with climate 
                        change-related hazards were found to be associated with youth’s knowledge of the 
                        effectiveness of individual climate mitigation actions. Empirical evidence from numerous 
                        studies supports these findings, highlighting that engagement in environmental activities 
                        fosters hands-on learning and exposure to climate knowledge, enhancing awareness of 
                        impactful actions(Croak & Walker, 2024). Moreover, youth who perceive a high risk of climate 
                        change are more motivated to learn about mitigation strategies, reinforcing the idea that 
                        perceived personal relevance drives knowledge acquisition(Croak & Walker, 2024). Finally, 
                        personal experiences with climate-related events, such as flooding, landslides, or droughts, 
                        further amplify this understanding by making the consequences of climate change tangible and 
                        urgent, prompting a deeper understanding of effective mitigation actions(Spence et al., 2011).

                    Conclusion
                </h2>
                <p>In conclusion, while activities with little impact—like recycling and upgrading light bulbs—
                    are overestimated, those with great impact—like having less than one kid, following a plant
                   based diet, and living without a car—are underestimated. These findings emphasize the need 
                   for education, involvement in environmental initiatives, and personal experiences with climatic 
                   events. Future research could use mixed-methods and strategies combining surveys with 
                   qualitative interviews or focus groups to get closer to the factors influencing young people's 
                   perspective on the effectiveness of individual actions in lessening climate change.

                <p>This study, however, has its shortcomings, including the fact that it was conducted using online 
                    surveys, excluding young people without internet access, which are a sizeable portion of our 
                    population. Future studies could be community-based, in which all youth will be included. 
                    Additionally, the survey did not include youth from the rural parts of Tanzania. Future studies 
                    could thus incorporate a more geographically varied sample, including urban and rural 
                    locations, promoting better awareness among youth in various socioeconomic and cultural 
                    environments. Comparative studies across many other countries and regions can also serve to 
                    highlight various regional difficulties and opportunities for effective climate change education 
                    and policy intervention.
