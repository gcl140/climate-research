                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>The study aimed to assess the level of individual Youth Knowledge regarding the effectiveness of
                    various individual climate change mitigation actions. In responding to this the quantitative data
                    collection and analysis approach were adopted. The data were collected through an online survey of
                    the youth 15-24 years old to respond to the gap. The data collected were analyzed and presented to
                    respond to the study objectives. The data collected show that there is limited knowledge regarding
                    the effectiveness of their action in climate change mitigation. But also, the data demonstrate that
                    social media are the main source of knowledge for youth about climate change. This implies that to
                    win youth in imparting knowledge social media is among the powerful tools to use. It was recommended
                    to include youth to advocate for climate change and strengthen the initiative for climate change
                    mitigation. </p>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Climate change is one of the most persistent global challenges, with widespread implications for
                    environmental, social, and economic systems. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
                    has underscored the urgency of taking swift and decisive action to limit global warming to 1.5°C
                    above pre-industrial levels. The IPCC's reports suggest that even a 1.5°C increase will result in
                    more extreme weather patterns, rising sea levels, and adverse effects on ecosystems, food security,
                    and human health (IPCC, 2021). International agreements and commitments, such as the Paris Agreement
                    (2015), emphasize the need for both collective and individual action. Countries are encouraged to
                    submit nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and outline efforts to reduce greenhouse gas
                    emissions. However, mitigating climate change requires more than government actions; individual
                    behaviors play a critical role. Scholars and policymakers alike have advocated for increased public
                    awareness and individual actions, including reducing carbon footprints through energy conservation,
                    sustainable consumption, and active participation in environmental movements (Stern, 2000).
                </p>
                <br>
                Recent global movements, such as the Fridays for Future initiative led by youth activist Greta
                Thunberg, have highlighted the pivotal role of youth in driving climate action. Young people,
                especially in developed nations, are more likely to engage in environmentally conscious behaviors
                and advocate for sustainable practices. However, there is growing concern that while youth are
                increasingly aware of the climate crisis, they may lack detailed knowledge of how individual actions
                translate into meaningful impact (O’Brien et al., 2018).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In Africa, the impact of climate change is particularly severe, with the continent facing heightened
                    vulnerability due to its reliance on rain-fed agriculture, water scarcity, and limited adaptive
                    capacity. The African Union (AU) and regional bodies like the East African Community (EAC) have
                    developed climate change frameworks aimed at fostering regional cooperation to enhance resilience
                    and adaptive capacity. Initiatives such as the African Adaptation Initiative (AAI) highlight the
                    need for local engagement and the empowerment of vulnerable communities, including the youth, to
                    tackle the climate crisis.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In Tanzania, climate change poses significant threats to livelihoods, especially in rural
                    communities reliant on agriculture, fishing, and tourism. The government of Tanzania has committed
                    to integrating climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies into national development plans.
                    Tanzania’s NDC outlines goals such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy
                    projects, afforestation, and sustainable land management (URT, 2021). Despite these efforts,
                    awareness and understanding of climate change and the effectiveness of individual actions remain
                    limited, particularly among the youth. Studies suggest that many young people in Tanzania have some
                    knowledge of climate change but are unclear about how individual behaviors contribute to global
                    mitigation efforts (Kangalawe & Lyimo, 2013). There is a need to assess youth knowledge to better
                    inform policy and education strategies that promote sustainable actions at the individual level.

                <h2>Statement of the problem </h2>
                <p>The global climate crisis has raised concerns about the effectiveness of individual actions in
                    mitigating climate change, yet youth awareness and knowledge on this matter remain unclear.
                    Literature indicates that young people are a key demographic in driving environmental change due to
                    their openness to adopting sustainable lifestyles (O'Brien & Selboe, 2015). However, there is a
                    knowledge gap regarding how well they understand the impact of their actions on climate change
                    mitigation. In many developing countries, including Tanzania, efforts to educate the youth about
                    climate change often focus on large-scale interventions, forgetting the importance of small,
                    everyday choices such as energy conservation, recycling, and sustainable consumption (UNESCO, 2016).
                    Without proper understanding, the youth may undervalue their role in climate action, resulting in
                    insufficient engagement in personal behavioral changes aimed at reducing carbon emissions.<br>
                <p>Furthermore, despite global initiatives aimed at educating the public on climate change, studies show
                    that youth knowledge about climate change is often shallow and lacks depth, particularly in
                    assessing how individual actions contribute to broader climate goals (Leiserowitz et al., 2020). In
                    Tanzania, where the impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly evident, there is limited
                    empirical research on how informed young people are about their contributions to climate resilience
                    (Mwenda, 2019). In addressing this gap, the level of individual Youth Knowledge regarding the

                <h2>Significance of Study </h2>
                <p>The study sought to assess the youth’s knowledge of the effectiveness of various individual-level
                    climate change mitigation actions, highlighting both high-impact and low-impact actions. It aimed to
                    identify gaps in youths' knowledge and analyze the factors influencing these gaps, such as
                    educational background and access to information. Additionally, the study aimed to offer actionable
                    recommendations for enhancing climate education programs and provide insights to guide policymakers
                    and organizations in developing educational strategies that better support and engage youth in
                    impactful climate mitigation efforts.

                    Globally, the United Nations (UN) defines youth as individuals aged between 15 and 24 years (UN,
                    2021). Also, the African Youth Charter categorizes youth as persons between 15 and 35 years old
                    (African Union, 2006). In Tanzania, the National Youth Development Policy defines youth as
                    individuals aged between 15 and 35 years, acknowledging the extended period of dependency and
                    socio-economic challenges many young people face in the country (URT, 2007). In this study, the
                    global view of youth was adopted as the term youth represented individuals ranging from 15-24 and
                    was used to understand their level of awareness in action related to climate change.

                <p>
                    According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climate action involves reducing
                    greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to sustainable energy sources, and enhancing societal
                    adaptation to climate-related risks (IPCC, 2018). Moser (2010) emphasizes that defining climate
                    action is not only technical solutions but also shifts in policies and societal behavior in adapting
                    and mitigating climate crises. In this study climate action will involve also actions that have a
                    direct or indirect impact on reducing or resolving the climate crises </p>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Climate change mitigation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), mitigation involves human
                    interventions that aim to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of GHGs (IPCC, 2014). Stern (2007)
                    also defines climate mitigation as the global response to reduce emissions by promoting low-carbon
                    technologies, improving energy efficiency, and adopting renewable energy sources. In this study, the
                    definition of IPCC we adopted as climate mitigation implies any intervention, initiatives, or
                    actions aiming to reduce the impact related to climate change </p>

                <p>
                    The study adopted a quantitative cross-sectional research design, which was chosen to provide a
                    detailed understanding of youth knowledge on the effectiveness of individual actions in mitigating
                    climate change. This design facilitated the collection of data at a single point in time, allowing
                    for a broad examination of the factors influencing climate change mitigation behavior among the
                    youth. The approach focused on participants aged 15 to 24, residing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The
                    region was purposefully selected due to its diverse population and status as a commercial hub, which
                    ensured access to participants from a range of social, economic, and cultural backgrounds. This
                    diversity was essential to capture varied perspectives on climate change mitigation behaviors.</p>

                <p>
                    A total of 300 youths participated in the study, with the sample size determined based on the
                    availability of potential respondents and the need for statistical validity in the analyses. The
                    survey was administered online using Google Forms, with the link distributed through direct outreach
                    methods to ensure broad participation. Before completing the survey, participants were required to
                    sign an online consent form, ensuring ethical standards were maintained. For participants under 18,
                    parental consent was mandatory before participation. The survey itself took approximately 10 minutes
                    to complete, and responses were collected and stored using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 29 for
                    analysis.

                    performed to analyze the demographic by calculating the frequency and percentage of the
                    participants' demographic. But also, the Chi-squared test was performed to identify statistically
                    significant differences in knowledge levels based on socio-demographic characteristics, and beliefs
                    Pickering et al. (2020). Additionally, one-way ANOVA tests explored correlations between
                    participants’ knowledge scores and their reported sources of information on climate change.

                    The data on gender distribution shows that the majority of the sample comprises males, accounting
                    for 63.3% (190 individuals), while females make up 36.7% (110 individuals). This indicates a
                    significant gender difference, which could potentially influence the outcomes of the study,
                    especially if the research focuses on topics where gender plays a critical role, such as
                    participation in economic activities or social behaviors. The underrepresentation of females may
                    suggest existing gender imbalances in the community or could reflect sample selection criteria. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In terms of age distribution, the sample is predominantly composed of youth aged 15-19 years, who
                    constitute 60% of the participants (180 individuals). The remaining 40% (120 individuals) belong to
                    the 20-24 age group. This concentration in the younger age bracket may impact the findings,
                    particularly in studies related to issues such as education, employment, or health, as younger
                    participants may have different perspectives and experiences compared to older counterparts.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Regarding education levels, the largest proportion of the sample, 39.3% (118 individuals), has
                    completed primary education. Secondary education is the second most common level, with 29% (87
                    individuals), while a smaller percentage of the participants (8.7%, or 26 individuals) have attained
                    university-level education. A notable 23% (69 individuals) have no formal education. This
                    educational distribution may reflect the broader access to education in the community and could have
                    implications for various socio-economic indicators, such as employment, income generation, or access
                    to resources. The relatively low percentage of individuals with higher education may also affect the
                    capacity for informed decision-making in areas like climate change mitigation, civic participation,
                    or economic empowerment.

                    regarding the effectiveness of various individual actions in mitigating climate change.
                    Participants' ages ranged from 15 to 24 years. About half of the participants (51.7%) were females
                    and more than a third (37.3%) had a primary education level. (Table 1).

                <p>
                    This was addressed by looking at how the respondents were aware of the effectiveness of their
                    actions which could contribute to climate mitigation. Respondents were given six behaviors that
                    individuals could take personally to help lessen CC and were asked to rank (1-6) them according to
                    their perceived effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, assigning from highest to lowest
                    rank. The data show that Youths ranked recycling as the most effective (mean rank of 1.5) this was
                    followed by living car-free (mean rank of 2.6), replacing gasoline cars with hybrid cars (mean rank
                    of 3.8), upgrading light bulbs (mean rank of 3.8), Eat a plant-based diet (mean rank of 4.0) and the
                    least effective action was considered to be having one free child (mean rank of 5.3). (Figure 1).

                    We also determined whether perceptions on effectiveness of individual level actions in
                    mitigating climate change varied with gender, age groups, education level and area of residency.
                    The perceptions on effectiveness of individual level actions in mitigating climate change showed
                    no significant variation with gender (p = 0.191), age groups (p = 0.105) educational levels (p =

                    individual level actions in mitigating climate change varied with personal experiences with
                    climate-related events, Involvement in Environmental Activities, Peer and family influence. The
                    perceptions on effectiveness of individual level actions in mitigating climate change showed
                    significant variation with personal experiences with climate-related events (p = 0.017),

                    To address the second research question, participants were asked to rank six behaviors according
                    to their perceived effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, assigning '1'
                    representing the highest impact and '6' the lowest. We hypothesized that these rankings would
                    differ from those determined by a study conducted by Wynes and Nicholas (2017). Specifically, we
                    expected respondents to overestimate the effectiveness of the less impactful behaviors. We used
                    Wilcoxon signed rank tests to determine if there are significant differences in how youth rank
                    the impact of various individual actions compared to established rankings by Wynes and Nicholas
                    (2017)(5). The test showed statistically significant differences between how youth participants
                    ranked certain behaviors compared to calculated rankings derived from Wynes and Nicholas (2017).
                    Youths rated "having one fewer child" (Z = -13.8, p < 0.001) and "eat a plant-based diet" (Z=-7.58,
                        p < 0.0001) as less impactful. In contrast, they perceived "recycling" (Z=-14.7, p < 0.0001) to
                        be more impactful than the calculated rankings. </p>

                            We also determined whether knowledge on the effectiveness of individual actions in
                            mitigating climate change was associated with select independent variables. To do this
                            we first calculated an ‘effectiveness knowledge score’ (EKS). This score was derived by
                            taking the absolute value of the difference between a respondent’s ranking of each
                            action and the ‘true’ rank from Wynes and Nicholas (2017), and then calculating the mean
                            of these differences for each respondent. A score of zero indicated perfect alignment
                            with the calculated ranks (indicating high knowledge), while a score of three indicated
                            the greatest disparity in ranks (indicating low knowledge).

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Regarding demographic factors, the effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) showed no
                            significant variation with gender (p = 0.383) or age groups (p = 0.229). However,
                            significant differences were observed among educational levels (p = 0.04), with
                            participants having secondary and university education levels demonstrating lower EKS
                            (mean 1.61 and 1.52, respectively) compared to those with no education and primary
                            education levels, where the mean EKS was 2.3 and 1.9, respectively. This suggests that
                            individuals with higher educational attainment possess greater knowledge of the relative
                            effectiveness of individual climate change mitigation actions.

                        <p>
                            We also determined that the effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) showed significant
                            variation among those with participation in different environmental activities (p=
                            0.015) where those who have participated in different environmental activities
                            demonstrated lower EKS (mean 1.42) compared those who had not participated in different
                            environmental activities (mean 1.77). This suggests that individuals with who
                            participate in different environmental activities possess greater knowledge of the
                            relative effectiveness of individual climate change mitigation actions. In addition, the
                            effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) showed significant variation among those with
                            personal experiences with climate-related events where those with personal experiences
                            with climate-related events had demonstrated lower EKS mean 1.268 p= 0.003) compared
                            those who had no personal experiences with climate-related events (mean 1.68 p= 0.438).
                            This suggests that individuals with personal experiences with climate-related events
                            possess greater knowledge of the relative effectiveness of individual climate change
                            mitigation actions. However, the effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) showed no
                            significant variation among among those who believed that they were at risk to climate
                            change related events (mean 1.87 p = 0.36) and those who perceived they were at no risk
                            (mean 1.92 p = 0.24).

                            We also performed a series of one-way ANOVAs tests to explore potential correlations
                            between different sources of information about climate change, as reported by
                            respondents and their effectiveness knowledge score (EKS). However, all tests resulted
                            in non-significant results (p > 0.05). This suggests that no statistically significant
                            associations were observed between any specific information source and participants' EKS
                            in this study.

                            Regarding beliefs about climate change mitigation, there was no notable difference in
                            EKS between individuals who do not believe their actions or lifestyle choices can
                            contribute to reducing climate change (mean EKS = 1.8049; n = 251) and those who do
                            believe (mean EKS = 1.792; n = 49 p = 0.89).

                <h2>Discussion</h2>
                <p>
                    In our study, we explored youth’s knowledge and their perception on the effectiveness of
                    individual actions for mitigating climate change. First, we examined whether youth believe that
                    their individual actions can help to mitigate climate change. Second, we investigated the
                    knowledge of youth regarding the relative efficacy of different individual actions in combating
                    climate change. Third we examined how accuracy of knowledge varied according to age groups,
                    gender, education levels. We conducted a quantitative, cross-sectional study with 300
                    participants from Dar es Salaam region.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Our findings showed that a majority (83.7%) expressed belief in the effectiveness of personal
                    actions in mitigating climate change, supporting our H1. This highlights a generally positive
                    attitude towards individual responsibility in environmental stewardship. These findings are in
                    line with research by Udas et al.,(2021) which has shown that youth express a felt
                    responsibility to act on climate change and reduce anthropogenic impacts on the Earth(18).
                    Recognizing the importance of individual empowerment and perceived influence among youth in
                    their environmental actions, these results substantial significance.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Many participants skeptical about the impact of individual actions highlighted external factors,
                    predominantly blaming corporations and large companies for environmental degradation. These
                    participants felt disillusioned believing that individual actions were insignificant in
                    comparison to industrial and systemic sources of pollution. This perspective highlights the
                    challenge of fostering attitudes of personal responsibility, particularly given the broader
                    environmental impacts of corporate practices. It underscores the need for targeted educational
                    strategies and policy interventions to empower individuals and promote collective action toward
                    sustainable environmental practices. Movements such as Friday for future founded by Greta
                    Thunberg and other Student’s activists have mobilized many youths to action, such as through
                    school ‘climate strikes’ (19). However, It remains to be determined if such awareness-raising
                    will translate into a belief of greater agency amongst youth over CC mitigation at the
                    individual level.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    While the majority of youths believed in the efficacy of their actions and lifestyle choices in
                    combating climate change, we also evaluated their knowledge around the relative impact of
                    various behaviors. Our findings showed that behaviors with lower impact, such as recycling and
                    reducing waste, tend to be overestimated, while the most impactful behavior of choosing to have
                    one fewer child is underestimated, supporting our hypothesis (H2). Previous research among US
                    adults has similarly found discrepancies in estimating the savings of different activities
                    (Attari et al., 2010). The perceived effectiveness of recycling, highlighted in our study, could
                    be explained by the fact that this is a behavior where youth can exert significant agency,
                    contrasting with actions like sustainable food consumption that may require more resources and
                    autonomy within family environments. Therefore, it is not surprising that recycling ranked high
                    among actions perceived as impactful, possibly reinforced by frequent exposure to recycling bins
                    and programs at school and elsewhere on a daily basis.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The most impactful behaviour rated in our study—having one fewer child—was scored as the least
                    effective at reducing GGE. This can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, this perception
                    may stem from a lack of understanding among youth regarding the long-term and cumulative impact
                    of population growth on carbon emissions. Individuals may prioritize more immediate or visible
                    actions, such as recycling or energy-saving measures, which they perceive as directly
                    influencing environmental outcomes they can observe in their daily lives. Moreover, cultural and
                    societal norms often emphasize personal consumption choices over demographic factors like family
                    size when discussing climate change mitigation. Thus, conversations on climate change mitigation
                    should broaden to include discussions on the long-term implications of demographic factors like
                    family size on carbon emissions. This is because choosing to have one fewer child by a US
                    family, as noted by Wynes and Nicholas (2017), can achieve emissions reductions equivalent to
                    those made by 684 teenagers adopting lifelong comprehensive recycling habits (p3). The impact of
                    this choice is significant due to the cumulative reduction in emissions across future
                    generations, as highlighted in life cycle assessments by Murtaugh and Schlax (2009).
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The findings of our study offer many groups of people (teachers, students, parents, policy
                    makers or any education practitioners) with a message that while youth generally believe in the
                    effectiveness of individual actions to mitigate climate change, there is a need for education
                    that accurately informs them about the relative impact of different behaviors to foster more
                    informed environmental stewardship. Therefore, prioritizing the integration of comprehensive
                    climate change education into school curricula is essential. Such education should encompass not
                    only the scientific aspects of climate change but also the effectiveness of diverse mitigation
                    actions. Finally, future research could be conducted by addressing some of the limitations of
                    the current study, by including a more geographically diverse sample, encompassing both urban
                    and rural areas, as well as different regions within Tanzania and other countries in the global
                    South. This approach would provide a more comprehensive understanding of youth perceptions and
                    behaviours across various socio-economic and cultural contexts. Additionally, comparative
                    studies between different regions and countries could highlight unique regional challenges and
                    opportunities for effective climate change education and policy interventions. We also recommend
                    incorporating mixed-methods approaches that combine surveys with qualitative interviews or focus
                    groups in order to get deeper insights into the factors influencing youth perceptions and
                    actions related to climate change.

                    from Dar es Salaam region in Tanzania from November 2019 to February 2020. Tanzania, an East
                    African country, is divided into 31 regions, with Dar es Salaam serving as its commercial
                    capital. Dar es Salaam region was purposely selected due to its diverse population and
                    accessibility, making it representative of urban youth in the region. Study participants were
                    recruited from their homes through door-to-door visits.

                <p> Data collection involved the use of interviewer-administered questionnaires. The interviewers
                    explained the purpose of the study to interested youths and obtained their consent. For
                    participants under 18 years old, consent was obtained from both the youths and their parents or
                    guardians. The survey took approximately 10 minutes to complete.

                    The primary data collection instrument was a structured questionnaire. Participants were
                    initially asked, "Do you believe that your activities or lifestyle choices can help to lessen
                    climate change?" with a yes or no response option. Those who responded "no" were then asked,
                    "Why do you believe that your activities or lifestyle choices cannot help to lessen climate
                    change?" (open-ended response, no word limit). These qualitative responses were subsequently
                    compiled and summarized.

                    To assess knowledge of individual-level climate change mitigation behaviors, participants were
                    asked to rank six behaviors by their perceived ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GGE):
                    live car-free, have one fewer child, eat a plant-based diet, switch from an electric car to
                    car-free, recycle, and upgrade lightbulbs. These behaviors represent four high-impact, one
                    moderate-impact, and one low-impact actions, as calculated by Wynes and Nicholas (2017). The
                    order of presentation of behaviors was randomized, with a rank of one indicating the most
                    reduction in emissions and six the least reduction.
