                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>The study aimed to assess the level of individual Youth Knowledge regarding the effectiveness of
                    various individual climate change mitigation actions. In responding to this the quantitative data
                    collection and analysis approach were adopted. The data were collected through an online survey of
                    the youth 15-24 years old to respond to the gap. The data collected were analyzed and presented to
                    respond to the study objectives. The data collected show that there is limited knowledge regarding
                    the effectiveness of their action in climate change mitigation. But also, the data demonstrate that
                    social media are the main source of knowledge for youth about climate change. This implies that to
                    win youth in imparting knowledge social media is among the powerful tools to use. It was recommended
                    to include youth to advocate for climate change and strengthen the initiative for climate change
                    mitigation. </p>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Climate change is one of the most persistent global challenges, with widespread implications for
                    environmental, social, and economic systems. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
                    has underscored the urgency of taking swift and decisive action to limit global warming to 1.5°C
                    above pre-industrial levels. The IPCC's reports suggest that even a 1.5°C increase will result in
                    more extreme weather patterns, rising sea levels, and adverse effects on ecosystems, food security,
                    and human health (IPCC, 2021). International agreements and commitments, such as the Paris Agreement
                    (2015), emphasize the need for both collective and individual action. Countries are encouraged to
                    submit nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and outline efforts to reduce greenhouse gas
                    emissions. However, mitigating climate change requires more than government actions; individual
                    behaviors play a critical role. Scholars and policymakers alike have advocated for increased public
                    awareness and individual actions, including reducing carbon footprints through energy conservation,
                    sustainable consumption, and active participation in environmental movements (Stern, 2000).
                </p>
                <br>
                Recent global movements, such as the Fridays for Future initiative led by youth activist Greta
                Thunberg, have highlighted the pivotal role of youth in driving climate action. Young people,
                especially in developed nations, are more likely to engage in environmentally conscious behaviors
                and advocate for sustainable practices. However, there is growing concern that while youth are
                increasingly aware of the climate crisis, they may lack detailed knowledge of how individual actions
                translate into meaningful impact (O’Brien et al., 2018).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Africa, the impact of climate change is particularly severe, with the continent facing heightened
                    vulnerability due to its reliance on rain-fed agriculture, water scarcity, and limited adaptive
                    capacity. The African Union (AU) and regional bodies like the East African Community (EAC) have
                    developed climate change frameworks aimed at fostering regional cooperation to enhance resilience
                    and adaptive capacity. Initiatives such as the African Adaptation Initiative (AAI) highlight the
                    need for local engagement and the empowerment of vulnerable communities, including the youth, to
                    tackle the climate crisis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Tanzania, climate change poses significant threats to livelihoods, especially in rural
                    communities reliant on agriculture, fishing, and tourism. The government of Tanzania has committed
                    to integrating climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies into national development plans.
                    Tanzania’s NDC outlines goals such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy
                    projects, afforestation, and sustainable land management (URT, 2021). Despite these efforts,
                    awareness and understanding of climate change and the effectiveness of individual actions remain
                    limited, particularly among the youth. Studies suggest that many young people in Tanzania have some
                    knowledge of climate change but are unclear about how individual behaviors contribute to global
                    mitigation efforts (Kangalawe & Lyimo, 2013). There is a need to assess youth knowledge to better
                    inform policy and education strategies that promote sustainable actions at the individual level.

                <h2>Statement of the problem </h2>
                <p>The global climate crisis has raised concerns about the effectiveness of individual actions in
                    mitigating climate change, yet youth awareness and knowledge on this matter remain unclear.
                    Literature indicates that young people are a key demographic in driving environmental change due to
                    their openness to adopting sustainable lifestyles (O'Brien & Selboe, 2015). However, there is a
                    knowledge gap regarding how well they understand the impact of their actions on climate change
                    mitigation. In many developing countries, including Tanzania, efforts to educate the youth about
                    climate change often focus on large-scale interventions, forgetting the importance of small,
                    everyday choices such as energy conservation, recycling, and sustainable consumption (UNESCO, 2016).
                    Without proper understanding, the youth may undervalue their role in climate action, resulting in
                    insufficient engagement in personal behavioral changes aimed at reducing carbon emissions.<br>
                <p>Furthermore, despite global initiatives aimed at educating the public on climate change, studies show
                    that youth knowledge about climate change is often shallow and lacks depth, particularly in
                    assessing how individual actions contribute to broader climate goals (Leiserowitz et al., 2020). In
                    Tanzania, where the impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly evident, there is limited
                    empirical research on how informed young people are about their contributions to climate resilience
                    (Mwenda, 2019). In addressing this gap, the level of individual Youth Knowledge regarding the

                <h2>Significance of Study </h2>
                <p>The study sought to assess the youth’s knowledge of the effectiveness of various individual-level
                    climate change mitigation actions, highlighting both high-impact and low-impact actions. It aimed to
                    identify gaps in youths' knowledge and analyze the factors influencing these gaps, such as
                    educational background and access to information. Additionally, the study aimed to offer actionable
                    recommendations for enhancing climate education programs and provide insights to guide policymakers
                    and organizations in developing educational strategies that better support and engage youth in
                    impactful climate mitigation efforts.

                    Globally, the United Nations (UN) defines youth as individuals aged between 15 and 24 years (UN,
                    2021). Also, the African Youth Charter categorizes youth as persons between 15 and 35 years old
                    (African Union, 2006). In Tanzania, the National Youth Development Policy defines youth as
                    individuals aged between 15 and 35 years, acknowledging the extended period of dependency and
                    socio-economic challenges many young people face in the country (URT, 2007). In this study, the
                    global view of youth was adopted as the term youth represented individuals ranging from 15-24 and
                    was used to understand their level of awareness in action related to climate change.

                <p>
                    According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climate action involves reducing
                    greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to sustainable energy sources, and enhancing societal
                    adaptation to climate-related risks (IPCC, 2018). Moser (2010) emphasizes that defining climate
                    action is not only technical solutions but also shifts in policies and societal behavior in adapting
                    and mitigating climate crises. In this study climate action will involve also actions that have a
                    direct or indirect impact on reducing or resolving the climate crises </p>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Climate change mitigation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), mitigation involves human
                    interventions that aim to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of GHGs (IPCC, 2014). Stern (2007)
                    also defines climate mitigation as the global response to reduce emissions by promoting low-carbon
                    technologies, improving energy efficiency, and adopting renewable energy sources. In this study, the
                    definition of IPCC we adopted as climate mitigation implies any intervention, initiatives, or
                    actions aiming to reduce the impact related to climate change </p>

                <h2>Methodologies </h2>
                <p>
                    The study adopted a quantitative cross-sectional research design, which was chosen to provide a
                    detailed understanding of youth knowledge on the effectiveness of individual actions in mitigating
                    climate change. This design facilitated the collection of data at a single point in time, allowing
                    for a broad examination of the factors influencing climate change mitigation behavior among the
                    youth. The approach focused on participants aged 15 to 24, residing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The
                    region was purposefully selected due to its diverse population and status as a commercial hub, which
                    ensured access to participants from a range of social, economic, and cultural backgrounds. This
                    diversity was essential to capture varied perspectives on climate change mitigation behaviors.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A total of 300 youths participated in the study, with the sample size determined based on the
                    availability of potential respondents and the need for statistical validity in the analyses. The
                    survey was administered online using Google Forms, with the link distributed through direct outreach
                    methods to ensure broad participation. Before completing the survey, participants were required to
                    sign an online consent form, ensuring ethical standards were maintained. For participants under 18,
                    parental consent was mandatory before participation. The survey itself took approximately 10 minutes
                    to complete, and responses were collected and stored using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 29 for
                    analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data collection involved an online survey to assess youths' knowledge regarding individual-level
                    climate change mitigation behaviors which was categorized based on their impact level on climate
                    change mitigation. Participants were asked to rank these behaviors based on their perceived
                    effectiveness in reducing.

                <p>
                    The data collected were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 29. The analyzed data were
                    presented in tables to describe the information and its implications. The descriptive analysis was
                    performed to analyze the demographic by calculating the frequency and percentage of the
                    participants' demographic. But also, the Chi-squared test was performed to identify statistically
                    significant differences in knowledge levels based on socio-demographic characteristics, and beliefs
                    Pickering et al. (2020). Additionally, one-way ANOVA tests explored correlations between
                    participants’ knowledge scores and their reported sources of information on climate change.

                    The data on gender distribution shows that the majority of the sample comprises males, accounting
                    for 63.3% (190 individuals), while females make up 36.7% (110 individuals). This indicates a
                    significant gender difference, which could potentially influence the outcomes of the study,
                    especially if the research focuses on topics where gender plays a critical role, such as
                    participation in economic activities or social behaviors. The underrepresentation of females may
                    suggest existing gender imbalances in the community or could reflect sample selection criteria. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In terms of age distribution, the sample is predominantly composed of youth aged 15-19 years, who
                    constitute 60% of the participants (180 individuals). The remaining 40% (120 individuals) belong to
                    the 20-24 age group. This concentration in the younger age bracket may impact the findings,
                    particularly in studies related to issues such as education, employment, or health, as younger
                    participants may have different perspectives and experiences compared to older counterparts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regarding education levels, the largest proportion of the sample, 39.3% (118 individuals), has
                    completed primary education. Secondary education is the second most common level, with 29% (87
                    individuals), while a smaller percentage of the participants (8.7%, or 26 individuals) have attained
                    university-level education. A notable 23% (69 individuals) have no formal education. This
                    educational distribution may reflect the broader access to education in the community and could have
                    implications for various socio-economic indicators, such as employment, income generation, or access
                    to resources. The relatively low percentage of individuals with higher education may also affect the
                    capacity for informed decision-making in areas like climate change mitigation, civic participation,
                    or economic empowerment.

                    In this study, we examined youth’s knowledge of the effectiveness of individual actions in
                    mitigating climate change. We asked two research questions about the accuracy of knowledge among
                    youths regarding the effectiveness of various individual actions in mitigating climate change and on

                    regarding the effectiveness of various individual actions in mitigating climate change.
                    Participants' ages ranged from 15 to 24 years. About half of the participants (51.7%) were females
                    and more than a third (37.3%) had a primary education level. (Table 1).

                    Level of Knowledge about individual actions that could mitigate climate change
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This was addressed by looking at how the respondents were aware of the effectiveness of their
                    actions which could contribute to climate mitigation. Respondents were given six behaviors that
                    individuals could take personally to help lessen CC and were asked to rank (1-6) them according to
                    their perceived effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, assigning from highest to lowest
                    rank. The data show that Youths ranked recycling as the most effective (mean rank of 1.5) this was
                    followed by living car-free (mean rank of 2.6), replacing gasoline cars with hybrid cars (mean rank
                    of 3.8), upgrading light bulbs (mean rank of 3.8), Eat a plant-based diet (mean rank of 4.0) and the
                    least effective action was considered to be having one free child (mean rank of 5.3). (Figure 1).

                    Figure 1: Youth ranking of the efficacy of actions in reducing GGE compared to actual ranks (based
                    on calculations of study by Wynes et al (Wynes & Nicholas, 2017).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then used Wilcoxon signed rank tests to determine if there are significant differences in how
                    youth rank the impact of various individual actions compared to established rankings of Wynes et al
                    (5). The test demonstrated statistically significant variations on how youths ranked these behaviors
                    in comparison to the calculated rankings derived from a study by of Wynes et al (5). Youths rated
                    recycling" (Z = -15.5 p < 0.0001) to be the most impactful, this was followed by living car free
                        (Z=-9.2 p < 0.0001), replacing gasoline cars with hybrid cars ((Z=-2.4 p < 0.017), upgrading
                        light bulbs (Z=-14.1 p < 0.0001), Eat a plant-based diet (Z=-10.4 p < 0.0001) and the least
                        effective action was considered to be having one free child (Z=-15.4 p < 0.0001) This may be
                        because of the truth that most of the climate activist they most talk about the issue of
                        recycling. But also, most of the intervention proceeding in the local community is the issue of
                        recycling and forgetting to speak about other behaviors that are most contributing to climate
                        change mitigation. This data implies the existing gap in awareness regarding the actions
                        contributing to climate change. This was supported by (Ivanaj, 2024) explain the increase in
                        publicly available information about the causes and consequences of climate change, as well as
                        about actions to be taken to mitigate it, has an important positive influence on public problem
                        awareness. This in turn positively influences both personal efficacy and public behavioral
                        intentions to fight climate change, two key mediators that spur positive changes in desired
                        climate-friendly public behaviors according to (Wolf & Moser, 2019) the review highlights great
                        variation and sometimes a direct contradiction of view. This calls for attention regarding
                        knowledge of public understanding and engagement. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            From this study youths with personal experiences of climate-related events possessed
                            significantly greater knowledge of the effectiveness of individual climate change mitigation
                            actions compared to those without such experiences. These findings indicate that personal
                            experiences with climate-related events such as floods, droughts, or extreme weather
                            conditions often serve as powerful motivators for individuals to seek more information about
                            climate change and its mitigation(Sambrook et al., 2021). Those who have lived through
                            climate-related events are more likely to engage in discussions, educational programs, and
                            community initiatives focused on climate change(Sambrook et al., 2021). These findings align
                            with existing literature where Spence et al found that individuals who had experienced
                            flooding had a significantly higher awareness and concern about climate change(Spence et
                            al., 2011). Personal experiences with flooding /droughts tend to provide survivors with
                            opportunities to learn about effective climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies
                            and their potential impact(Demski et al., 2017). Education programs should incorporate
                            personal stories and case studies of individuals who have experienced climate-related
                            events. As Ardoin et al. pointed out in their analysis of environmental education programs,
                            storytelling, especially involving real-life experiences, increased student engagement and
                            retention of information(Ardoin et al., 2020).

                        <p>
                            Regarding demographic factors, the effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) was not found to show
                            statistically significant variation with gender (p = 0.093) or age groups (p = 0.650).
                            However, statistically significant differences were observed among different educational
                            levels (p = 0.015, where participants having university education levels demonstrated lower
                            EKS (mean = 1.9) compared to those with no education, primary education levels, and
                            secondary education (mean EKS was 2.4. 2.3 and 2.2, respectively). We also determined that
                            the effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) showed significant variation among those with
                            participation in different environmental activities (p= 0.015) where those who have
                            participated in different environmental activities demonstrated lower EKS (mean 2.0)
                            compared to those who had not participated in different environmental activities (mean 2.4).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, the effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) showed significant variation among
                            those with personal experiences with climate-related events whereas those with personal
                            experiences with climate-related events demonstrated lower EKS (mean 2.1) compared to those
                            who had no personal experiences with climate-related events (mean 2.3). The effectiveness
                            knowledge score (EKS) also showed significant variation (p-value = 0.000) among those who
                            believed that they were at risk of climate change-related events (mean 2.0) and those who
                            perceived they were at no risk (mean 2.3). We also asked participants whether they believe
                            individual actions or lifestyle choices can help mitigate climate change. A majority of
                            youth (83.7%) responded that they did believe their actions or lifestyle choices could help
                            in the mitigation of climate change. Those who didn’t believe in the effectiveness of their
                            actions were asked to provide reasons for their disbelief. Majority attributed their
                            skepticism to external factors such as; placing responsibility for pollution on large
                            companies and corporations. Additionally, some expressed a feeling of helplessness to take
                            responsibility stating reasons like "I don’t see others doing it, so why should I?" or
                            “Changing habits is very challenging." Some respondents displayed a lack of awareness about
                            climate change with comments such as "Climate change follows a natural cycle beyond human
                            control" or "I don't fully understand how individual actions impact climate change". In
                            general, responses indicated that participants could be categorized as belonging to one of
                            two groups—those who generally perceived that their actions couldn't make a difference and
                            finally those who lacked awareness on climate change, its causes, and mitigation actions.

                            The study's implications underscore the need for tailored educational and awareness-raising
                            initiatives that address the misconceptions held by different demographic groups. Despite a
                            high belief among youth (83.7%) in the power of individual actions to mitigate climate
                            change, many expressed skepticism due to perceived external factors or feelings of weakness.
                            This implies that informing individuals about climate change is insufficient. This calls for
                            effective communication strategies to empower and engage them. To overcome barriers, such as
                            the belief that largely affects changing personnel must focus on community-driven approaches
                            that illustrate the tangible impacts of collective individual actions. By reducing the
                            knowledge gaps and developing a sense of agency, such efforts could enhance public
                            understanding of climate change and promote proactive participation in mitigation
                            strategies.

                        <p>
                            From this study youths with personal experiences of climate-related events possessed
                            significantly greater knowledge of the effectiveness of individual climate change mitigation
                            actions compared to those without such experiences. These findings indicate that personal
                            experiences with climate-related events such as floods, droughts, or extreme weather
                            conditions often serve as powerful motivators for individuals to seek more information about
                            climate change and its mitigation(Sambrook et al., 2021). Those who have lived through
                            climate-related events are more likely to engage in discussions, educational programs, and
                            community initiatives focused on climate change(Sambrook et al., 2021). These findings align
                            with existing literature where Spence et al found that individuals who had experienced
                            flooding had a significantly higher awareness and concern about climate change(Spence et
                            al., 2011). Personal experiences with flooding /droughts tend to provide survivors with
                            opportunities to learn about effective climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies
                            and their potential impact(Demski et al., 2017). Education programs should incorporate
                            personal stories and case studies of individuals who have experienced climate-related
                            events. As Ardoin et al. pointed out in their analysis of environmental education programs,
                            storytelling, especially involving real-life experiences, increased student engagement and
                            retention of information(Ardoin et al., 2020).

                            The study also highlighted the role of education in shaping accurate climate knowledge.
                            Participants with higher levels of education, particularly those with university education,
                            demonstrated a better understanding of which actions are highly impactful, as evidenced by
                            lower effectiveness knowledge scores (EKS) compared to those with lower levels of education.
                            This suggests that greater exposure to scientific knowledge especially among those with
                            university education does provide students with a more comprehensive understanding of
                            environmental issues. For example, Youths with higher education levels e.g. university level
                            are more likely to encounter discussions on the impact of population dynamics, energy
                            consumption, and sustainable practices, which may not be covered as thoroughly in primary
                            education(Wang et al., 2022). Similar findings were obtained from a study that examined
                            public perceptions of climate change across 119 countries, which found that education is a
                            significant predictor of climate change knowledge and that individuals with higher levels of
                            education were more likely to understand the causes of climate change and have a better
                            understanding of different mitigation strategies(Feinstein & Mach, 2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, it should also be pointed out that in many African countries, only 23% to 33% of
                            children complete secondary school, and the current gross university enrollment ratio is
                            just 9.4%(Dispatch & Richard, 2024). Thus, it is necessary to integrate comprehensive
                            climate education across all levels of schooling. By doing so, it is possible to bridge the
                            knowledge gap and ensure that all individuals regardless of their educational background
                            have a basic understanding of the most effective actions they can take to combat climate
                            change. This will thus enable youths to make more informed decisions and have a greater
                            collective impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It is also critical to not forget
                            that almost 11% of youth in Tanzania have no formal education(Profile, 2018) and as pointed
                            out in our study youths with no formal education were not knowledgeable on the effectiveness
                            of these mitigative behaviors as demonstrated by their higher effectiveness knowledge score
                            (EKS). Therefore, policymakers need to find effective ways to reach this group of youths.
                            Isolating them because they are not in school would be a significant oversight, as they form
                            an important part of the youth community.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Furthermore, the study pointed out that individuals who participate in different
                            environmental activities possess greater knowledge of the relative effectiveness of
                            individual climate change mitigation actions than their counterparts. This finding indicates
                            that the more youth participate in activities that directly address environmental issues,
                            the more they learn about which behaviors and actions are impactful. Our findings align with
                            previous research by Ardoin et al. found that students who participated in outdoor
                            environmental programs demonstrated a significant increase in environmental knowledge and
                            pro-environmental behaviors compared to those who did not participate in such
                            activities(Ardoin et al., 2020). This highlights the critical role that active participation
                            plays in enhancing understanding and awareness of climate issues. This is because
                            participation in environmental activities often involves exposure to educational materials,
                            workshops, and discussions that increase awareness of the causes and impacts of climate
                            change. These further stress the importance of increasing awareness through education to
                            drive active participation at all community levels in addressing climate change. As pointed
                            out by a study by Akrofi et al. to achieve desired climate change-related action youths
                            should be encouraged to actively participate in climate change initiatives(Akrofi et al.,
                            2019).

                        <p>
                            The study also aims to understand the source of knowledge for youth about climate change.
                            The respondents were asked to select the source of knowledge. The data presents the sources
                            of knowledge about climate change among youth, revealing distinct differences in the
                            frequency of responses. Social media is the most significant source, with 90 respondents
                            indicating it as their primary means of obtaining information. Following that, the internet
                            garnered 63 responses, while mass media attracted 53. Family and friends contributed 47
                            responses, with the local community at 31 and government agencies lagging with only 17 as
                            presented in the figure below. These data show that most youth rely on digital platforms,
                            particularly social media, for information regarding climate change.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This data implies that there are importance of utilizing social media and online platforms
                            to disseminate information on climate change effectively. Since youth are highly engaged
                            with these sources, educational initiatives, and awareness campaigns can be more impactful
                            if conducted through these channels. This trend also indicates a potential gap in the
                            effectiveness of traditional information sources, such as government agencies and local
                            communities, suggesting a need for these entities to adapt their strategies to engage youth
                            better.

                                individual climate change mitigation actions. Such a knowledge gap has also been
                                documented
                                in a study by Pickering et al his study involved 17-18years old Canadian youths where
                                impact
                                behaviors such as recycling and reducing waste were overestimated as highly impactful
                                behaviors(Pickering et al., 2020) and from a study by Truelove and Gillis where
                                participants
                                consistently ranked recycling higher than scientifically supported high-impact
                                actions(Truelove & Parks, 2012). This overestimation can be explained by the fact that
                                recycling is one of the most visible and easily accessible actions and is more
                                encouraged
                                through public campaigns, community programs, and educational efforts, which tend to
                                create
                                a perception of them being a highly effective action. It should also be noted that
                                actions
                                such as recycling and upgrading light bulbs are actions that youths can exert
                                significant
                                control. Other actions such as; eating a plant-based diet, and living car do require
                                more
                                resources and autonomy within family environments(Pickering et al., 2020).

                                Also, youth in this study ranked having fewer children as least effective, a finding
                                that
                                contrasts sharply with the calculated ranks proposed by the study of Wynes et al which
                                ranked it as the most impactful behaviors(Wynes & Nicholas, 2017). This shows that
                                youths
                                are not fully aware of the significant impact that population growth has on greenhouse
                                gas
                                emissions. According to of Wynes et al study, having one fewer child can achieve
                                emissions
                                reductions equivalent to those made by 684 teenagers adopting lifelong comprehensive
                                recycling habits(Wynes & Nicholas, 2017). Similar findings were reported in a study done
                                by
                                Pickering et al where Canadian youth ranked having fewer than one child as the least
                                effective action(Pickering et al., 2020). Such misunderstandings stem from the fact that
                                while actions such as recycling are often promoted in environmental campaigns, the link
                                between family planning and climate change This can stem to the fact that while actions
                                like
                                recycling are often promoted in environmental campaigns, link between family planning
                                and
                                climate change is less frequently highlighted, particularly in youth-targeted
                                education(Götmark & Andersson, 2020). Also, in African societies such as those in
                                Tanzania,
                                the decision to have children is deeply embedded in traditions, cultural expectations,
                                and
                                economic considerations making the concept of having fewer children less likely to be
                                considered or prioritized by individuals(Maning et al., 2024). In Tanzania where the
                                population is projected to double every 23 years the conversations on climate change
                                mitigation should broaden to include discussions on the long-term implications of
                                increased
                                population growth on carbon emissions(‘TANZANIA: Economic Update’, 2021). This is
                                because
                                choosing to have one fewer child as noted by Wynes et al can achieve emissions
                                reductions
                                equivalent to those made by 684 teenagers adopting lifelong comprehensive recycling
                                habits(Wynes & Nicholas, 2017). The impact of this choice is significant due to the
                                cumulative reduction in emissions across future generations, as highlighted in life
                                cycle
                                assessments by Murtaugh and Schlax(Murtaugh & Schlax, 2009).

                                ANOVA tests to explore potential correlations between different sources of information

                                However, all tests resulted in non-significant results (p > 0.05). This suggests that no
                                statistically significant associations were observed between any specific information

                                In this study, we aimed to explore youth’s knowledge of the effectiveness of individual
                                actions for mitigating climate change. First, we assessed the knowledge of the relative
                                effectiveness of different individual climate mitigation actions. Second, we looked into
                                what factors were associated with youth’s knowledge of the relative effectiveness of
                                different individual climate mitigation actions. Our findings showed that youth did
                                overestimate the effectiveness of lower-impact behaviors while underestimating the
                                effectiveness of the high-impact behaviors. Also, knowledge did vary significantly among
                                youths with different education levels, among those who engage in different
                                environmental
                                activities and those who do not engage in different environmental activities, those who
                                perceive to be at risk of climate-related events, and those who don’t perceive
                                themselves to
                                be at risk and those who have personal experience with climate-related events such as
                                flooding, drought and those who have no such experiences.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This was also the case in a study by Pickering et al where having different information
                                sources had no association with knowledge of the effectiveness of individual climate
                                change
                                mitigation actions(Pickering et al., 2020). This can be attributed to the fact that
                                various
                                sources whether it’s the internet, social media, or mass media do convey similar
                                messages or
                                content regarding climate change mitigation, this eventually leads to a uniform level of
                                knowledge among participants, regardless of the specific sources(Adetayo et al., 2023).
                                It
                                should also be pointed out that the effectiveness of information in enhancing knowledge
                                may
                                depend more on its quality and depth rather than the medium through which it is
                                received(Adetayo et al., 2023). This is to say that brief news headlines or social media
                                posts may provide awareness but lack the depth needed to significantly impact
                                participants'
                                knowledge. To enrich public understanding and foster innovation in climate change
                                mitigation, it is crucial to incorporate diverse perspectives and approaches in
                                educational
                                and communication strategies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Also, our study found no significant difference in the knowledge of the effectiveness of
                                individual climate change mitigation actions between individuals who believe their
                                actions
                                or lifestyle choices can contribute to reducing climate change and those who do not.
                                Similar
                                findings were obtained from a study done by Pickering et al where knowledge showed no
                                significant variation in youth’s beliefs on whether their actions or lifestyle choices
                                can
                                contribute to reducing climate change. This points out a general lack of awareness or
                                understanding about specific actions that can effectively mitigate climate change among
                                both
                                groups(Salvador Costa et al., 2022). This suggests that individuals, regardless of
                                belief,
                                may not have access to detailed or high-quality information about what actions are most
                                impactful. Efforts should be made to address the gap between belief systems and
                                knowledge.
                                This involves creating educational content that resonates with individuals' values and
                                beliefs while providing clear, actionable information about climate change mitigation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, the study found that factors such as; participation in environmental
                                activities, perceived risk of climate change-related hazards, and personal experiences
                                with
                                climate change-related hazards were found to be associated with youth’s knowledge of the
                                effectiveness of individual climate mitigation actions. These findings do suggest that
                                youth’s knowledge of the effectiveness of individual climate mitigation actions is
                                shaped by
                                their involvement in environmental activities, perceived risk of climate-related
                                hazards,
                                and personal experiences with such events. Empirical evidence supports these findings
                                highlighting that, from different studies, engagement in environmental activities
                                fosters
                                hands-on learning and exposure to climate knowledge, enhancing awareness of impactful
                                actions(Croak & Walker, 2024). Moreover, youths who perceive a high risk from climate
                                change
                                are more motivated to learn about mitigation strategies, reinforcing the idea that
                                perceived
                                personal relevance drives knowledge acquisition(Croak & Walker, 2024). Lastly, personal
                                experiences with climate-related events, such as flooding, landslides, or droughts,
                                further
                                amplify this understanding by making the consequences of climate change tangible and
                                urgent,
                                prompting a deeper understanding of effective mitigation actions(Spence et al., 2011).

                <p>
                    In conclusion, the study demonstrates that less impactful actions such as recycling and upgrading
                    light bulbs have their significance overestimated while most impactful actions such as having fewer
                    than one child, adopting a plant-based diet, and living car-free have their significance
                    underestimated. These findings underscore the impact of education, active participation in
                    environmental activities, and personal experiences with climate events in shaping accurate climate
                    knowledge. Future research could incorporate mixed-methods approaches that combine surveys with
                    qualitative interviews or focus groups to get deeper insights into the factors shaping youth’s
                    knowledge of the effectiveness of individual actions in mitigating climate change.

                    This study however had multiple limitations such as it was done through online surveys potentially
                    leaving out youth with no internet access that make up a significant part of our population. Future
                    studies may involve a community-based study where all youth will be included in the study. Also, the
                    study involved youths living in Dar es Salaam city potentially leaving out those that reside in
                    rural areas of Tanzania thus future research could be conducted by including a more geographically
                    diverse sample, encompassing both urban and rural areas, as well as different regions within
                    Tanzania and other countries in the global South. This approach would provide a more comprehensive
                    understanding of youth knowledge across various socio-economic and cultural contexts. Additionally,
                    comparative studies between different regions and countries could highlight unique regional
                    challenges and opportunities for effective climate change education and policy interventions.
