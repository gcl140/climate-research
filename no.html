    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>In this study, we explored youth’s knowledge and their perception on the effectiveness of
        individual
        actions in mitigating climate change. We asked these research questions on whether youths
        believe
        that their activities or lifestyle choices can help to lessen climate change, what is the
        accuracy
        of knowledge among youths regarding the effectiveness of various individual actions in
        mitigating
        climate change and what factors do influence youth’s perceptions and knowledge on effectiveness
        of
        individual actions in mitigating climate change? </p>

        300 youths from Dar es Salaam region were recruited in the study. Participants ages ranged from
        13
        to 24 years with 110 (36.7%) females and 190 (63.3%) males. Participant’s education levels were
        26.0% with no formal education, 37.3% with primary education, 22.0% with secondary education,
        and
        14.7% with university education

        We also determined whether perceptions on effectiveness of individual level actions in
        mitigating climate change varied with gender, age groups, education level and area of residency.
        The perceptions on effectiveness of individual level actions in mitigating climate change showed
        no significant variation with gender (p = 0.191), age groups (p = 0.105) educational levels (p =
        0.415 or area of residency (p= 0.16). We also determined if perceptions on effectiveness of
        individual level actions in mitigating climate change varied with personal experiences with
        climate-related events, Involvement in Environmental Activities, Peer and family influence. The
        perceptions on effectiveness of individual level actions in mitigating climate change showed
        significant variation with personal experiences with climate-related events (p = 0.017),
        Involvement in Environmental Activities (p= 0.006), and perceived risk of climate related events
        (p = 0.0012) but showed no significant variation with influence from peers and effect from
        family influence where p values were 0.46 and 0.32 respectively.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        To address the second research question, participants were asked to rank six behaviors according
        to their perceived effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, assigning '1'
        representing the highest impact and '6' the lowest. We hypothesized that these rankings would
        differ from those determined by a study conducted by Wynes and Nicholas (2017). Specifically, we
        expected respondents to overestimate the effectiveness of the less impactful behaviors. We used
        Wilcoxon signed rank tests to determine if there are significant differences in how youth rank
        the impact of various individual actions compared to established rankings by Wynes and Nicholas
        (2017)(5). The test showed statistically significant differences between how youth participants
        ranked certain behaviors compared to calculated rankings derived from Wynes and Nicholas (2017).
        Youths rated "having one fewer child" (Z = -13.8, p < 0.001) and "eat a plant-based diet" (Z=-7.58,
            p < 0.0001) as less impactful. In contrast, they perceived "recycling" (Z=-14.7, p < 0.0001) to
            be more impactful than the calculated rankings. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We also determined whether knowledge on the effectiveness of individual actions in
                mitigating climate change was associated with select independent variables. To do this
                we first calculated an ‘effectiveness knowledge score’ (EKS). This score was derived by
                taking the absolute value of the difference between a respondent’s ranking of each
                action and the ‘true’ rank from Wynes and Nicholas (2017), and then calculating the mean
                of these differences for each respondent. A score of zero indicated perfect alignment
                with the calculated ranks (indicating high knowledge), while a score of three indicated
                the greatest disparity in ranks (indicating low knowledge).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Regarding demographic factors, the effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) showed no
                significant variation with gender (p = 0.383) or age groups (p = 0.229). However,
                significant differences were observed among educational levels (p = 0.04), with
                participants having secondary and university education levels demonstrating lower EKS
                (mean 1.61 and 1.52, respectively) compared to those with no education and primary
                education levels, where the mean EKS was 2.3 and 1.9, respectively. This suggests that
                individuals with higher educational attainment possess greater knowledge of the relative
                effectiveness of individual climate change mitigation actions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We also determined that the effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) showed significant
                variation among those with participation in different environmental activities (p=
                0.015) where those who have participated in different environmental activities
                demonstrated lower EKS (mean 1.42) compared those who had not participated in different
                environmental activities (mean 1.77). This suggests that individuals with who
                participate in different environmental activities possess greater knowledge of the
                relative effectiveness of individual climate change mitigation actions. In addition, the
                effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) showed significant variation among those with
                personal experiences with climate-related events where those with personal experiences
                with climate-related events had demonstrated lower EKS mean 1.268 p= 0.003) compared
                those who had no personal experiences with climate-related events (mean 1.68 p= 0.438).
                This suggests that individuals with personal experiences with climate-related events
                possess greater knowledge of the relative effectiveness of individual climate change
                mitigation actions. However, the effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) showed no
                significant variation among among those who believed that they were at risk to climate
                change related events (mean 1.87 p = 0.36) and those who perceived they were at no risk
                (mean 1.92 p = 0.24).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We also performed a series of one-way ANOVAs tests to explore potential correlations
                between different sources of information about climate change, as reported by
                respondents and their effectiveness knowledge score (EKS). However, all tests resulted
                in non-significant results (p > 0.05). This suggests that no statistically significant
                associations were observed between any specific information source and participants' EKS
                in this study.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Regarding beliefs about climate change mitigation, there was no notable difference in
                EKS between individuals who do not believe their actions or lifestyle choices can
                contribute to reducing climate change (mean EKS = 1.8049; n = 251) and those who do
                believe (mean EKS = 1.792; n = 49 p = 0.89).

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>
        In our study, we explored youth’s knowledge and their perception on the effectiveness of
        individual actions for mitigating climate change. First, we examined whether youth believe that
        their individual actions can help to mitigate climate change. Second, we investigated the
        knowledge of youth regarding the relative efficacy of different individual actions in combating
        climate change. Third we examined how accuracy of knowledge varied according to age groups,
        gender, education levels. We conducted a quantitative, cross-sectional study with 300
        participants from Dar es Salaam region.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Our findings showed that a majority (83.7%) expressed belief in the effectiveness of personal
        actions in mitigating climate change, supporting our H1. This highlights a generally positive
        attitude towards individual responsibility in environmental stewardship. These findings are in
        line with research by Udas et al.,(2021) which has shown that youth express a felt
        responsibility to act on climate change and reduce anthropogenic impacts on the Earth(18).
        Recognizing the importance of individual empowerment and perceived influence among youth in
        their environmental actions, these results substantial significance.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Many participants skeptical about the impact of individual actions highlighted external factors,
        predominantly blaming corporations and large companies for environmental degradation. These
        participants felt disillusioned believing that individual actions were insignificant in
        comparison to industrial and systemic sources of pollution. This perspective highlights the
        challenge of fostering attitudes of personal responsibility, particularly given the broader
        environmental impacts of corporate practices. It underscores the need for targeted educational
        strategies and policy interventions to empower individuals and promote collective action toward
        sustainable environmental practices. Movements such as Friday for future founded by Greta
        Thunberg and other Student’s activists have mobilized many youths to action, such as through
        school ‘climate strikes’ (19). However, It remains to be determined if such awareness-raising
        will translate into a belief of greater agency amongst youth over CC mitigation at the
        individual level.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        While the majority of youths believed in the efficacy of their actions and lifestyle choices in
        combating climate change, we also evaluated their knowledge around the relative impact of
        various behaviors. Our findings showed that behaviors with lower impact, such as recycling and
        reducing waste, tend to be overestimated, while the most impactful behavior of choosing to have
        one fewer child is underestimated, supporting our hypothesis (H2). Previous research among US
        adults has similarly found discrepancies in estimating the savings of different activities
        (Attari et al., 2010). The perceived effectiveness of recycling, highlighted in our study, could
        be explained by the fact that this is a behavior where youth can exert significant agency,
        contrasting with actions like sustainable food consumption that may require more resources and
        autonomy within family environments. Therefore, it is not surprising that recycling ranked high
        among actions perceived as impactful, possibly reinforced by frequent exposure to recycling bins
        and programs at school and elsewhere on a daily basis.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        The most impactful behaviour rated in our study—having one fewer child—was scored as the least
        effective at reducing GGE. This can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, this perception
        may stem from a lack of understanding among youth regarding the long-term and cumulative impact
        of population growth on carbon emissions. Individuals may prioritize more immediate or visible
        actions, such as recycling or energy-saving measures, which they perceive as directly
        influencing environmental outcomes they can observe in their daily lives. Moreover, cultural and
        societal norms often emphasize personal consumption choices over demographic factors like family
        size when discussing climate change mitigation. Thus, conversations on climate change mitigation
        should broaden to include discussions on the long-term implications of demographic factors like
        family size on carbon emissions. This is because choosing to have one fewer child by a US
        family, as noted by Wynes and Nicholas (2017), can achieve emissions reductions equivalent to
        those made by 684 teenagers adopting lifelong comprehensive recycling habits (p3). The impact of
        this choice is significant due to the cumulative reduction in emissions across future
        generations, as highlighted in life cycle assessments by Murtaugh and Schlax (2009).
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        The findings of our study offer many groups of people (teachers, students, parents, policy
        makers or any education practitioners) with a message that while youth generally believe in the
        effectiveness of individual actions to mitigate climate change, there is a need for education
        that accurately informs them about the relative impact of different behaviors to foster more
        informed environmental stewardship. Therefore, prioritizing the integration of comprehensive
        climate change education into school curricula is essential. Such education should encompass not
        only the scientific aspects of climate change but also the effectiveness of diverse mitigation
        actions. Finally, future research could be conducted by addressing some of the limitations of
        the current study, by including a more geographically diverse sample, encompassing both urban
        and rural areas, as well as different regions within Tanzania and other countries in the global
        South. This approach would provide a more comprehensive understanding of youth perceptions and
        behaviours across various socio-economic and cultural contexts. Additionally, comparative
        studies between different regions and countries could highlight unique regional challenges and
        opportunities for effective climate change education and policy interventions. We also recommend
        incorporating mixed-methods approaches that combine surveys with qualitative interviews or focus
        groups in order to get deeper insights into the factors influencing youth perceptions and
        actions related to climate change.

<div id="section10">
    <h2>Study Design & Participants</h2>
    <p>We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study that enrolled 300 youths aged 15 to 24 years
        from Dar es Salaam region in Tanzania from November 2019 to February 2020. Tanzania, an East
        African country, is divided into 31 regions, with Dar es Salaam serving as its commercial
        capital. Dar es Salaam region was purposely selected due to its diverse population and
        accessibility, making it representative of urban youth in the region. Study participants were
        recruited from their homes through door-to-door visits.
    </p>
</div>
<div id="section11">
    <h2>Data Collection Procedures</h2>
    <p> Data collection involved the use of interviewer-administered questionnaires. The interviewers
        explained the purpose of the study to interested youths and obtained their consent. For
        participants under 18 years old, consent was obtained from both the youths and their parents or
        guardians. The survey took approximately 10 minutes to complete.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        The primary data collection instrument was a structured questionnaire. Participants were
        initially asked, "Do you believe that your activities or lifestyle choices can help to lessen
        climate change?" with a yes or no response option. Those who responded "no" were then asked,
        "Why do you believe that your activities or lifestyle choices cannot help to lessen climate
        change?" (open-ended response, no word limit). These qualitative responses were subsequently
        compiled and summarized.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        To assess knowledge of individual-level climate change mitigation behaviors, participants were
        asked to rank six behaviors by their perceived ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GGE):
        live car-free, have one fewer child, eat a plant-based diet, switch from an electric car to
        car-free, recycle, and upgrade lightbulbs. These behaviors represent four high-impact, one
        moderate-impact, and one low-impact actions, as calculated by Wynes and Nicholas (2017). The
        order of presentation of behaviors was randomized, with a rank of one indicating the most
        reduction in emissions and six the least reduction.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Basic demographic variables were also collected, including age, gender, level of education, and
        type of curriculum. Sources of climate change information were determined using a
        check-all-that-apply format with 11 response options.
    </p>
</div>
<div id="section12">
    <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>Once responses were collected, all information was coded and entered into SPSS version 24 for
        statistical analysis. Summary statistics were used to describe the demographic characteristics
        of the participants. Chi-squared tests were conducted to determine if responder status (yes or
        no) was associated with demographic variables. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare
        the rankings of GGE-reducing behaviors provided by participants with those calculated by Wynes
        and Nicholas (2017).
